# ofxInsensitiveOsc

this ofxOscReceiver doesn't terminate when receive broken packet.

based on `ofxOsc@oF0.9.2`.

this addon trashes broken packets with error messages.

i think, this error handling is not best but, as better than app terminate.

(maybe i will post PR or issue about this problem to openFrameworks community.)
